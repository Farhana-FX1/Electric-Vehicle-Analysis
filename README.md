# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis
Welcome to my Power BI dashboard project! This analysis explores Electric Vehicle (EV) population data to uncover insights into adoption trends, vehicle types, and manufacturer impact. It's a hands-on demonstration of my Power BI skills — from data modeling to visual storytelling.

## Dashboard Insights
This Power BI dashboard spans multiple reports, each offering deep insights into the EV landscape:
- Overview of EV population — total count, trends by year, and top-performing vehicle makes and models
- Geographic analysis — state/city-wise EV distribution and adoption heatmaps
- Fuel and drivetrain types — comparison between hybrid, electric, and plug-in models
- Manufacturer analysis — identifying top EV makers and their market shares
- Advanced filters — interactive slicers for make, model year, location, and fuel type
Each page is designed for interactivity and drill-through — allowing stakeholders to explore EV trends from multiple angles.
